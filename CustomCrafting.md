The CFC Survival server includes multiple custom crafting recipes.

# Bulk Crafting:
Using logs to craft a chest will yield 4 chests, making it easier to craft large amounts of chests without needing to break the logs down into planks first.

Any combination of log-types will work, including stripped logs.

Similarly, Bone-blocks can be crafted directly from bones

# Easy Dispenser
Dispensers can be crafting a bow around a dropper, making bulk crafting much easier. The vanila recipe is still in place.

# End Crystal
In addition to the vanilla recipe, two end crystals can be obtained from the Dragon Egg, which is now a guarenteed drop from the Ender Dragon, and can also be found in End City chests.

# Noch Apple
Enchanted Golden Apples can be duplicated by combining a regular golden apple, an enchanted golden apple, and 7 blocks of gold.
